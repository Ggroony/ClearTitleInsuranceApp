Clear Title Title Insurance Web Application - Created with PyWebIo

I currently work in Title Real Estate in an Administrative role, however my boss asked if I could create something for the company as a fun project to work on while in the office that flexed my new skills!

We were in the need as a company with a quick way for our clients and loan officers to generate a policy quote - instead of hiring our web devleopers for our website or our underwriters to create it which would have been incredibly
expensive, they asked me! 

This is my first experience working with the PyWebio framework and it is wonderful! Very simple, very limited CSS/HTML - it's nice to know a bit of it so you can customize but you could get away with knowing very little of it

I will do my best to updload the fully completed project (as you can see from my files there are a few methods and functions yet to create).
