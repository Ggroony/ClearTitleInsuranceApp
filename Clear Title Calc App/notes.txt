The following application will recieve input from the user including:

*County 
*Loan Amount
*Purchase Amount/Sales Price

Then the application will output the estimated amount that the title insurance will be,
including tax and endorsements (always including 8.1 and 9 endorsements)

Pretty simple. I will need to grab the county tax info for each county to feed into the system, and the rates that
either old republic charges or FNF. 

I'm going to use PyWebIo framework to create a webbased application without having to mess with HTML and CSS


7/7 - using pywebio, I am not needing to edit much html and css, which is perfect. 

Needs: Come up with a function to correctly validate data in my forms (Check form function), Need to gather the output mathmatical data to create an output, come up with a way for the user to select
whether this will be a cash deal or not, removing the loan amount option. 

To be able to inform us when someone uses the application

Solved issue 7/7 - was having a really hard time figuring out how to reference the input funcitons in my outputs or even how to reference vairables within a function to the validate call, but discovered
that if I set up the variable as global first, it will be accesible. 

7/13 - I've organized the site a bit more to grab the information needed. Now I need to get the insurance rates from TW or OR - I'm thinking we'll just skip doing the municipality calculations since they can be so different
or providing a general tax rate with a disclaimer. The issue I'm running into now is converting the input to an integer or float so that I can mulitply it. I'll figure it out. 

OR Rate - Owners Basic Cash .003875

OR Rate - Lenders Simulateos LOAN - .00315
OR Rate - Owners - always $200
